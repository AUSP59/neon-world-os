# CII Best Practices Mapping
- Security: SECURITY.md, attestations (`attest`), integrity (`sealall`/`verify`), policy engine, safemode, SBOM.
- Quality: tests under `tests/`, CI-ready CTest targets, docs (`README.md`, `WHITEPAPER.md`), SPDX headers.
- Change Control: CONTRIBUTING.md, GOVERNANCE.md, CHANGELOG.md.
- Reporting: TRANSPARENCY.md, issue templates (to be hosted externally).
