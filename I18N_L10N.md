# I18N/L10N Policy
- CLI outputs **ASCII/UTF-8** only; no dependence on locale for semantics.
- Respects `NO_COLOR` and terminal width where applicable.
- JSON outputs are locale-agnostic; dates/times avoided in favor of ISO strings when necessary.
- CI runs across multiple locales/timezones (see `locale-matrix.yml`).
