> **Replace the contact emails below with real, monitored addresses before publishing.**

## 1) Our Pledge
We, as maintainers and contributors, commit to a community where everyone can participate without harassment or discrimination. We value empathy, kindness, and professionalism. We do not tolerate behavior that makes people feel unsafe, excluded, or unwelcome.

## 2) Our Standards
### Expected behavior
- Be respectful and assume good intent.
- Welcome questions; explain decisions with context.
- Give and accept constructive feedback.
- Use inclusive language; prefer gender-neutral terms.
- Respect privacy and personal boundaries.
- Focus on what is best for the project and community.

### Unacceptable behavior (non-exhaustive)
- Harassment, hate speech, or demeaning comments.
- Insults, personal attacks, or trolling.
- Unwanted sexualized language or imagery; sexual attention or advances.
- Violence or threats, stalking, or deliberate intimidation.
- Doxxing or publishing others’ private information.
- Discriminatory jokes or microaggressions after being asked to stop.
- Disruptive advertising/spam; off-topic or malicious content.
- Retaliation against people who report incidents.

## 3) Scope
This policy applies to all project spaces (GitHub issues/PRs/discussions, code review, docs, chats, events) and when representing the project in public. It also covers private communications made in the context of project work.

## 4) Reporting
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:
- **Email:** conduct@neon.example (Code of Conduct)  
- **Security vulnerabilities:** security@neon.example (see `SECURITY.md`)
- **If anyone is in immediate danger, contact local emergency services first.**

### What to include
Provide: your contact info, where and when it happened (links/screenshots), what was said/done, and any context. If you fear retaliation, say so; we will prioritize your safety.

### Confidentiality
Reports are kept as confidential as possible. We share details only with those who need them to take appropriate action. Anonymous reports are accepted, but may limit our ability to investigate.

## 5) Enforcement Process
- **Acknowledgment:** We confirm receipt within **48 hours** (business days).
- **Triage & assignment:** A neutral moderator reviews the report and assigns investigators. Conflicts of interest require recusal.
- **Assessment:** We gather context (logs, links, messages) and may contact involved parties.
- **Decision:** We determine impact and apply appropriate consequences (see below).
- **Communication:** We inform reporter(s) and the subject(s) of the outcome when appropriate.
- **Recordkeeping:** Minimal records are stored securely; access is restricted.

We may decline action when evidence is insufficient, behavior is outside scope, or reports are not made in good faith.

## 6) Consequences (Guideline)
- **Correction:** Private note clarifying expectations; edit/remove problematic content.
- **Official Warning:** Written warning stating behavior is unacceptable; further violations escalate.
- **Temporary Restrictions:** Muting, limited participation, or temporary ban from project spaces.
- **Permanent Ban:** Removal from the community and project spaces; in severe or repeated cases.
- **Event Actions (if any):** Removal from event, no refund, and possible ban from future events.

Project maintainers may take any action they deem necessary to keep the community safe, including actions not listed here.

## 7) Appeals
If you believe an action was taken in error or was unfair, email **appeals@neon.example** within **14 days**. An uninvolved maintainer will review the case. Decisions on appeal are final.

## 8) Moderator Guidelines (Summary)
- Act promptly, neutrally, and with empathy.
- Disclose conflicts; recuse when needed.
- Prefer minimal necessary intervention; escalate if behavior persists.
- Document decisions briefly (date, summary, action).
- Protect reporters from retaliation; monitor follow-up.

Inspired by widely adopted open-source community policies and best practices. This document uses original wording tailored for NEON-WORLD-OS.
